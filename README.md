Program I wrote for an Ag Cooperative back in 2005. When run, it gathers all the information off of a 
Windows PC from the registry and through other means. 

The most significant piece to this that may be of interest to someone, is the algorithm for decrypting the 
Windows Product Key for older versions of Windows.
